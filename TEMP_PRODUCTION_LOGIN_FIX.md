# Production Login Fix - Temporary Notes

## Date: 2025-08-11

## Issue
Production login was failing with "CredentialsSignin" error despite correct password.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Initial issue: JSON parse error due to special characters in password
2. User revealed actual password was "1234" not "AdminPass123!"
3. Database migrated to Supabase successfully
4. Session creation failing in production

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Production User Passwords
Created `update_prod_users.js` to set correct passwords:
- admin@school.edu / 1234
- sysadmin@cjcollegeprep.org / password123
- nsercan@cjcollegeprep.org / password123
- fbarker@cjcollegeprep.org / password123

### 2. Fixed NEXTAUTH_URL in Production
- Removed trailing newline character from NEXTAUTH_URL
- Set to: https://www.agendaiq.app

### 3. Created Debug Endpoint
- Added `/api/test-login` for debugging authentication
- Added to public endpoints in middleware.ts
- Will need to be removed after fixing issue

### 4. Files Created (Added to .gitignore)
- check_prod_user*.js
- update_prod_users.js
- setup_prod_admin.js
- fix_prod_admin.js
- fix_production_session.sh
- src/app/api/test-login/route.ts

### 5. Environment Variables Verified
- DATABASE_URL: Using Supabase with encoded password
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET: Consistent across environments
- NEXTAUTH_URL: Fixed in production

## Current Status
- Database connection: ✅ Working
- User passwords: ✅ Verified in database
- Test endpoint validation: ✅ Passwords work via /api/test-login
- NEXTAUTH_URL: ✅ Fixed (removed trailing newline)
- NextAuth ID type: ✅ Fixed (changed from number to string)
- Session creation: ❌ Still not working in browser
- CURL login: ✅ Works with proper CSRF token

## Next Steps
1. Test login with debug endpoint
2. Check JWT token generation
3. Verify session cookie settings
4. Remove test endpoint after fixing

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test login endpoint
curl -X POST "https://www.agendaiq.app/api/test-login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@school.edu","password":"1234"}'

# Test actual login
curl -X POST "https://www.agendaiq.app/api/auth/callback/credentials" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@school.edu","password":"1234","csrfToken":"..."}'
```

## IMPORTANT: Cleanup After Fix
1. Remove `/api/test-login` endpoint
2. Remove test-login from public endpoints in middleware
3. Delete all test scripts
4. Verify .gitignore covers all sensitive files
