- Do not change the port number. If the app doesn't start, kill the existing process using port 3000 instead of modifying it.

- If you reset the database, proceed with caution and ensure consistency across environments.

- Every time you make a change, use version control. Save the previous version of the file via Git and clearly document the modifications.

- Always use the issue tracking system to log tasks, bugs, or feature requests.

- Do not recreate entire files when adding a new feature or fixing an issue. Modify only the necessary parts.

- Always monitor server logs for potential issues.

- Before sharing the results of your changes, thoroughly test the app for any kind of errors.

- Before starting the app, run a complete error check.

- All feedback, documentation, and commit messages must be written in English.

- After each significant operation, verify that all pages are authenticated through the central auth system.

- Always use centralized CSS. Do not create file-specific custom styles.

- For GitHub synchronization:
  - Do not use emojis or icons in commit messages.
  - Provide detailed and clear commit descriptions.
  - All changes must be committed and pushed to feature branches regularly.
  - No direct commits to the `main` branch.
  - Every Monday, create a timestamped backup from the `main` or `release` branch to ensure version control.

- Never use mock data or `api_fallback` mocks. Always implement code that generates real-time data.

- Never use static data. Always fetch data from its original source on each run.
