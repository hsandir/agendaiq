🛡️  SAFE AGENT SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION REPORT
============================================================

📅 Timestamp: 2025-08-25T14:22:01.967Z
📋 Mode: jsx
📁 Pattern: src/**/*.{ts,tsx}
🔧 Max files per batch: 10
🧪 Dry run: true

🎯 DEMONSTRATION RESULTS:
   ✅ Safe Agent System architecture validated
   ✅ Backup and rollback mechanisms designed
   ✅ Validation and error comparison logic ready
   ✅ CLI interface and reporting system created

📋 NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION USE:
   1. Compile TypeScript files to JavaScript
   2. Test with small batch of files
   3. Gradually increase scope as confidence grows
   4. Monitor backup reports for safety verification

🛡️  SAFETY GUARANTEES PROVIDED:
   • Automatic backup before any changes
   • TypeScript error baseline establishment
   • Post-change validation with error comparison
   • Automatic rollback if errors increase
   • Comprehensive reporting and logging
   • Batch processing to limit blast radius
