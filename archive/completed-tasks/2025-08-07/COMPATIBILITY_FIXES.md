# Compatibility Fixes - AgendaIQ

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ localStorage SSR Error
**Problem**: `ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined` during server-side rendering.

**Root Cause**: ThemeProvider was trying to access localStorage during SSR when it's only available on the client.

**Solution**:
- Added `mounted` state to track client-side rendering
- Moved localStorage access to `useEffect` hook
- Added proper hydration mismatch prevention
- Only access localStorage after component mounts

**Code Changes**:
```tsx
// Before: Direct localStorage access in useState
const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(
  () => (localStorage?.getItem(storageKey) as Theme) || defaultTheme
);

// After: Client-side only access
const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(defaultTheme);
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true);
  const storedTheme = localStorage?.getItem(storageKey) as Theme;
  if (storedTheme) {
    setTheme(storedTheme);
  }
}, [storageKey]);
```

### 2. ✅ Prisma Field Compatibility
**Problem**: Old meeting data structure incompatible with new schema.

**Root Cause**: Schema changes from `attendees` to `MeetingAttendee` and field name updates.

**Solution**:
- Updated Prisma queries to use correct field names
- Fixed User model field references (`Staff` vs `staff`)
- Corrected meeting data transformation
- Ensured compatibility with both old and new meeting structures

**Code Changes**:
```tsx
// Before: Old field names
include: {
  attendees: {
    include: { staff: { include: { user: true } } }
  }
}

// After: New field names
include: {
  MeetingAttendee: {
    include: { 
      Staff: { include: { User: true } }
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. ThemeProvider Fix

- **Changes**: Added SSR-safe localStorage handling
- **Impact**: Eliminates hydration errors and SSR crashes

### 2. Meeting Detail Page Fix
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/meetings/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Updated Prisma queries and data transformation
- **Impact**: Old meetings now display correctly

## Testing Results

### SSR Compatibility
- ✅ No more localStorage errors during SSR
- ✅ ThemeProvider works on both server and client
- ✅ Proper hydration without mismatches

### Meeting Compatibility
- ✅ Old meetings load without errors
- ✅ New meetings work as expected
- ✅ Both data structures supported
- ✅ Attendee information displays correctly

### Server Status

2. **SSR Safety**: No more client-side only errors
3. **Hydration Stability**: Proper server/client rendering
4. **Future Proof**: Ready for schema evolution

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- All Prisma queries now use correct field names
- ThemeProvider is SSR-safe
- Meeting data transformation handles both old and new structures

### For Database
- Old meetings continue to work
- New meetings use updated schema
- No data migration required
